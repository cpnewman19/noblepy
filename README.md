# noblepy
A framework for analyzing noble gases in groundwater

noblepy supports functionality for:
1. Importing the results of noble-gas analyses from USGS laboratories and other labs
2. Rapid plotting of noble-gas concentrations and isotope ratios to evaluate hydrologic and geochemical processes
3. Evaluation of degassing during sample collection
4. Estimation of groundwater recharge parameters including excess air and recharge temperature
